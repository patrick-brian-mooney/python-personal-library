Patrick's personal Python library
=================================

This is a collection of utilities that I myself frequently use in my Python programs; many of my other scripts import
from it. There's no claim made that this is the best way to do things, but merely that I myself do things this way.
Your needs may differ. As a Pythonista, you may prefer to code your own solutions to these problems. Go for it. I
won't stop you. On the other hand, if you're using one of my other scripts to do things, it may be that the easiest
way to get the functionality needed by that script would simply be to import one of these files.

These scripts are copyright © 2015–22 by Patrick Mooney they are licensed under the GPL v3 or, at your option, any
later version. See the file LICENSE.md for a copy of this license. No warranty or guarantee of functionality is
represented here, though I'm glad if these scripts are helpful to you and would love to hear if you have thoughts or
feedback.

Version history, known bugs, and future plans are listed in the [HISTORY.md](https://github
.com/patrick-brian-mooney/python-personal-library/blob/master/HISTORY.md) file.

Maintaining version numbers for this motley collection of scripts was abandoned on 9 December 2016.
