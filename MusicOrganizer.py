"""A script to assist in organizing a directory of unprocessed music files: it
works toward validating basic assumptions about metadata tagging, and organizes
files into a regular directory structure. This is not a particularly
configurable tool in general, though some attention has been paid to basic
configurability.

Basic tasks performed as it traverses the specified directory:

* Pre-scans to find directories with music files.
* Traverses that list of directories, validating that music files found are
  not tagged in inappropriate ways. (Removes a lot of crufty metadata. Asks
  when it doesn't know what to do about a tag type.)
* Moves files into a new, regularized directory structure.

Does not yet, but will:

* convert files to an appropriate format. (Currently skips non-approved media
  file formats).

Currently, most usefully run from within an IDE with appropriate breakpoints so
its behavior can be observed.

This script takes a first pass at the needed work in order to eliminate
drudgery, but is not intended to be a substitute for human oversight in
caring for a file's metadata.

    "To process a folder" means to examine the files in the folder, determining which
    are music files that Mutagen can read, and then to organize the files in that
    directory, cleaning their tags, regularizing their names, and performing any
    other processing that is necessary; and then to move the files in that folder,
    as a group, to a new folder, in the configured output directory.

    Non-media files in the directory are moved to the new directory, too, without
    renaming them or making any attempt to process their contents. The intent is
    that all files in the source folder are moved to the destination folder, with
    the audio files renamed consistently after their metadata is cleaned, and with
    cover images, liner notes, booklet scans, data tracks, and other related files
    simply moved with the albums whose music files they accompany.

    We proceed from longer paths (judged by number of path components, not by string
    length) to shorter paths, because this facilitates the cleaning process we
    perform while going along.
