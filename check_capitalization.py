"""check_capitalization.py, by Patrick Mooney; 9 December 2016

This is a script to find capitalized words in the middle of sentences that
are not proper nouns (or approved other capitalized words). It also makes some
attempt to detect other capitalization problems. It goes through a text,
sentence by sentence, asking the user whether each sentence should be
capitalized. If not, it converts them to lowercase. When it has finished, it
writes the modified text back to the same file, i.e. it modifies the input file
in-place. It is primarily intended to check the output of my poetry_to_prose.py
script and was originally developed in order to facilitate the processing of a
complete edition of Shakespeare for my automated text blog Ulysses Redux.

Usage:

    ./check_capitalization.py [options] -i FILE

Options:

  -i FILE, --input FILE
      Specify the file to check. You may only process one file at a time with
      this script. If you do not specify a file, the script will ask you which
      file you want it to process.

  -l WORDLIST, --list WORDLIST
      Specify an additional list of words that are allowed to be capitalized
      without asking. If you add words to the list during a run of
      check_capitalization.py, the program will offer to overwrite the original
      file. This file is a simple text file containing one lowercase word per
      line. Don't edit this file during a run of the program; if you do, your
      changes will be overwritten when check_capitalization.py ends.

  -v, --verbose
      Increase the verbosity of the script, i.e. get more output. Can be
      specified multiple times to make the script more and more verbose.

  -q, --quiet
      Decrease the verbosity of the script. You can mix -v and -q, bumping the
      verbosity level up and down as the command line is processed, but really,
      what are you doing with your life?

  -h, --help
      Print this help message, then quit.

This script requires that NLTK be installed, because it relies on NLTK for a
lot of the work it does. See http://www.nltk.org/.
