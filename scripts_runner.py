Contains routines to interact with the file system. Currently, it contains the
following routines:

 * find_and_execute_scripts(): given a directory, executes all executable
   shell scripts (files with names ending in SH) in that directory and its
   subdirectories, then runs them.

When run from the command line, the script runs find_and_execute_scripts() in
the current directory.
