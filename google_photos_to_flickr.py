"""A quick script that takes a group of photos from Google checkout and uploads
those photos to Flickr. Works as of early March 2017, though it may or may not
have been kept up since then. Though there are plenty of things I don't like
about Google's photo-hosting and the way that its capabilities have shifted
since I started using it around 2008, Google deserves a lot of praise for
making it possible to easily download a user's own data in open formats. This
script is intended to ease the transition to another provider (currently
Flickr, about which I also have reservations, though I currently prefer them to
Google, largely because their photo servers seem to behave better and to take
less extreme measures to prevent users from doing what they want with their
photos other than downloading them).

This script assumes that the Google Takeout archive (or at least the subfolder
of the archive that contains the photos) has been expanded into a folder that
contains a series of subfolders, each of which represents what was an album on
Google Photos. It then tries to process each of these subfolders, uploading the
photos that it contains to Flickr. Since (in my experience) Google Takeout
archives don't have a particularly regular structure, it tries to deal with
this irregular data in at least a semi-robust way.

The Flickr API doesn't expose enough of Flickr's functionality in a documented
way to allow for the script to do all of its work automatically; in particular,
the Flickr API doesn't document a way to create new albums, despite the fact
that they promised to do so "soon" in a forum posting over nine years ago.
Because of this, some supervised work needs to be done: namely, the creation
and arrangement of albums. I deal with this by making sure the script turns the
old album name into a tag, then putting a breakpoint at the end of the album-
uploading procedure. When the script stops running, I go to Flickr, find the
new photos that have the tag in question, and organize them into an album by
hand. It's not perfect, but it seems to be the best I can do for now.
